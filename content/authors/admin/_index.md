I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in geophysics advised by Dr. [Jiajia Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun) in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/) at University of Houston. I obtained my M.S. in geology in 2018 from [Northwest University](https://www.nwu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, and B.S. in geophysics in 2015 from [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in Beijing.

With a burgeoning human population, growing needs for natural resources as well as concerns about global climate changes and natural hazards, integrating multiple geoscientific observations has drawn considerable attention to better comprehend Earth systems for a sustainable management of our planet. My research interests resolve around the theme of integrated Earth modeling and uncertainty analysis to investigate, understand and monitor various subsurface scenarios. My research interdisciplinarily utilizes, though by far not all, optimization, Monte Carlo, geostatistics, pattern recognition and mineralogy. I am currently working on joint inversion and uncertainty quantification using potential field (i.e., gravity, gradiometry and magnetic) and petrophysical (i.e., rock samples and drillhole) data, primarily applied to the [critical mineral](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals#:~:text=The%20Energy%20Act%20of%202020%20defines%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccritical%20mineral%E2%80%9D%20as,supply%20chain%20vulnerable%20to%20disruption.) explorations.

**Methodology Research:** a. Joint Inversion, b. Uncertainty Analysis, c. Geology Differentiation

**Application Research:** a. Natural Resources Exploration, b. Machine/Deep Learning
