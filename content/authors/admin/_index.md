I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in geophysics, in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at University of Houston. I obtained my M.S. in geology in 2018 from Northwest University, Xi'an, China, and B.S. in geophysics in 2015 from China University of Geosciences in Beijing.

In 21 century, population growth and climate change create urgent & challenging geoscience problems from sustainable management of natural resources (e.g. groundwater and critical minerals) to monitoring contaminants and natural hazards (e.g. landslides). Dynamics of all these problems are related to the properties and processes of the Earth’s subsurface, and therefore seeing below the subsurface is a fundamental knowledge required to solve (or help solve) these problems that we faced. My research focuses on advancing Earth Imaging techniques, which utilizes various types of sensors (e.g., ground-based, airborne, satellites) to measure data and images Earth’s subsurface from the data. In order to advance these imaging techniques, I use

My research interests resolve around the theme of inverse modeling for various subsurface systems. I currently focuse on joint inversion and uncertainty analysis using potential field and petrophysical data, primarily applied to critical mineral exploration.
