## I am a geoscience enthusiast interested in integrated Earth modeling and uncertainty analysis.

## I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in geophysics advised by Dr. [Jiajia Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun) at University of Houston.

<br>

With a burgeoning human population, growing needs for natural resources as well as concerns about global climate changes and natural hazards, a sustainable management of our planet has drawn considerable attention over the years. Integrating multiple geoscientific observations is one of the practical ways to better comprehend the Earth system. My research interests include:

Methodology Research: a. Joint Inversion, b. Uncertainty Analysis, c. Geology Differentiation

Application Research: a. Airborne Geophysics, b. Natural Resources Exploration, c. Machine/Deep Learning

<!-- I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in geophysics advised by Dr. [Jiajia Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun) in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/) at University of Houston. I obtained my M.S. in geology in 2018 at [Northwest University](https://www.nwu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, and B.S. in geophysics in 2015 at [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in Beijing.

With a burgeoning human population, growing needs for natural resources as well as concerns about global climate changes and natural hazards, a sustainable management of our planet has drawn considerable attention over the years. Integrating multiple geoscientific observations is one of the practical ways to better comprehend the Earth system. My research interests resolve around the theme of integrated Earth modeling and uncertainty analysis to investigate, understand and monitor various subsurface scenarios. My research interdisciplinarily utilizes, though by far not all, optimization, Monte Carlo, geostatistics, pattern recognition and mineralogy. I am currently working on the 3D Monte Carlo inversion and [critical mineral](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals#:~:text=The%20Energy%20Act%20of%202020%20defines%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccritical%20mineral%E2%80%9D%20as,supply%20chain%20vulnerable%20to%20disruption.) exploration using potential field (i.e., gravity, gradiometry and magnetic) and petrophysical (i.e., rock samples and drillhole) data.

**Methodology Research:** a. Joint Inversion, b. Uncertainty Analysis, c. Geology Differentiation

**Application Research:** a. Airborne Geophysics, b. Natural Resources Exploration, c. Machine/Deep Learning -->
