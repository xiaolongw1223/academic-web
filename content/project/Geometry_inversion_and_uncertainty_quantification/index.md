### Research Summary
We developed an efficient 3D trans-dimensional Monte Carlo framework for reconstructing the spatial geometry of an anomalous body using gravity data. The proposed framework can also quantify the uncertainty of the shape of an anomalous body recovered from geophysical measurements.
