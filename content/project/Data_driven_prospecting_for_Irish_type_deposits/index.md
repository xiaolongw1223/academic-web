The first and second row show the enhanced gravity and magnetic data maps, respectively. The horizontal, vertical, north-west and tilt derivatives are displayed from left to right.

### Project Summary
I collaboratively worked with my colleagues [Rob](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YfW-ScYAAAAJ), [Prithwijit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prithwijit-chakraborti-30bb0a15a/) and [Halleluya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/halleluya-naantu-ekandjo-68b58376/) from University College Dublin and [Caleb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ADCJzqQAAAAJ) from Colorado School of Mines on this project, supervised by Prof. [Aline Melo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vhVK1YIAAAAJ), [Jiajia Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=j8vhgpMAAAAJ), [Koen Torremans](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vRNHItwAAAAJ) and [Sean Johnson](https://people.ucd.ie/sean.johnson/about), for an international competition named as [Frank Arnott - Next Generation Explorers Award](https://www.pdac.ca/members/students/faa/about-the-award).

In this project, we employed airborne gravity, magnetic, electromagnetic, radiometric data sets, geochemical measures as well as geological bedrock maps to investigate the Irish-type deposits using the machine learning and conventional geophysical inversions.
