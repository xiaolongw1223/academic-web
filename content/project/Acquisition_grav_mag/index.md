### Project Summary

The Enchanted Rock is a large granite dome located approximately 17 miles north of Fredericksburg, Texas. The dome is the surface expression of a large igneous batholith, Town Mountain Granite, that intruded into metamorphic schist. We collected ground gravity and magnetic data over the Enchanted Rock.
